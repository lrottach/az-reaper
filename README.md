# Azure Reaper

**In the age-old dance of creation and destruction, behold Azure Reaper, a guardian wrought in code and cloud. Its purpose noble, it wields the power to vanquish Azure resources marked by timeâ€™s decree, ensuring realms of development and testing stand uncluttered, their legacies preserved in the annals of digital lore.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that Azure Reaper is currently undergoing a major rewrite to leverage the latest .NET and Azure Functions frameworks. The version available on the master branch is under active development and may be unstable. For those interested in the previous stable version, it can be found in the ./archive directory of this repository. I appreciate your interest and patience as I am working to improve the capabilities and performance of Azure Reaper.

Azure Functions based automation to automatcially delete special tagged Resource Groups. Perfect for dev and test environments to save cost and get all the cleanup tasks out of your head.  
The idea is based on Jeff Holan's great [functions-csharp-entities-grimreaper](https://github.com/jeffhollan/functions-csharp-entities-grimreaper), rewritten in a more simple form without the Twilio SMS part. 

## Status
The Azure Reaper is currently under development.  
Documentation, getting started and deployment guides will follow as soon as possible after the first release.
