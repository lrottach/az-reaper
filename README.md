# Azure Reaper
Azure Functions based automation to automatcially delete special tagged Resource Groups. Perfect for dev and test environments to save cost and get all the cleanup tasks out of your head.  
The idea is based on Jeff Holan's great [functions-csharp-entities-grimreaper](https://github.com/jeffhollan/functions-csharp-entities-grimreaper), rewritten in a more simple form without the Twilio SMS part. 

## Status
The Azure Reaper is currently under development.  
Documentation, getting started and deployment guides will follow as soon as possible after the first release.
