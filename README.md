# Azure Reaper
Azure Functions based automation to automatcially delete special tagged Resource Groups. Perfect for dev and test environments to save cost.  
The idea is based on Jeff Holan's great [functions-csharp-entities-grimreaper](https://github.com/jeffhollan/functions-csharp-entities-grimreaper), rewritten in a more simple form without the Twilio SMS part.
