# Azure Reaper

**In the age-old dance of creation and destruction, behold Azure Reaper, a guardian wrought in code and cloud. Its purpose noble, it wields the power to vanquish Azure resources marked by timeâ€™s decree, ensuring realms of development and testing stand uncluttered, their legacies preserved in the annals of digital lore.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please note that Azure Reaper is currently undergoing a major rewrite to leverage the latest .NET and Azure Functions frameworks. The version available on the master branch is under active development and may be unstable. For those interested in the previous stable version, it can be found in the ./archive directory of this repository. I appreciate your interest and patience as I am working to improve the capabilities and performance of Azure Reaper.

Azure Reaper is a sophisticated automation tool built on the robust foundation of Azure Functions to streamline the management of your cloud environment. This solution specializes in automatically deleting groups of resources tagged to your specifications, making it ideal for development and test environments. With Azure Reaper, you not only save money by eliminating unnecessary resource sprawl, but you also reduce the burden of manual cleanup. Leverage this seamless integration into your workflow to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and maintain a focused, clutter-free cloud environment.
The idea is based on Jeff Holan's great [functions-csharp-entities-grimreaper](https://github.com/jeffhollan/functions-csharp-entities-grimreaper), rewritten in a more simple form without the Twilio SMS part. 

## Status
Azure Reaper is under active development and is constantly evolving. The capabilities and performance of the project are continually being improved. As development progresses, comprehensive documentation, getting started guides, and deployment instructions will be provided. Your patience and contributions are greatly appreciated. Stay tuned for update!
